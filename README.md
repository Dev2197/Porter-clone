# Porter-clone


PorterClone.in

The easiest way to move goods across cities.

Hello, Me and my friends have tried to clone the Porter.in website here, it sure was a difficult task but we came through.
It is always a great experience to create something using the knowledge we have acquired here. So we were given a week to show our ability to put in all our skills inclusive of (coding, teamwork, communication and collaboration).
On the 1st day, we divided our work and decided on whichever page we are comfortable with. After deciding week decided on a common time that we will have our meeting. So that we can clear our doubts and other issue we might face.

Through this process of making this website we also learned about a things or too. The Whole week we were coming with idea that we can make our work easy as we are still in the beginning phase so we though of not using the complex CSS and JS we come up with ideas to make it look similar but with less or easy code.
The pages we complete which gave us a feel of accomplishment, after collaborating and pushing all the pages and data to main in GitHub we tested the website a little and made the explanation video.
I am lucky to have my teammate that were really helpful, and helped me in few things. Which I feel will help me in my future endeavors.

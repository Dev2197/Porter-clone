### About

> We did this project within 6 days in our unit-3 construct week. We focus more on the design and front-end parts but we also add some cool functionality in our courses page where you can order a serviace ccording to your choice and also you can pick places from the dropdown menu (PickUp & DropOff destination). And now in Unit-4 we are working on the backend part of our project and the flow from which our frontend will connect and collect data to backend.
